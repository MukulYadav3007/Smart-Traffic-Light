This project focuses on optimizing traffic light scheduling based on real-time vehicle density detection. The system dynamically adjusts signal timings to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow efficiency.
**Key Features:**

Uses real-time vehicle detection and density estimation.
Categorizes traffic as high, medium, or low for adaptive scheduling.
Implements an algorithm to optimize signal timing based on live road conditions.
Aims to enhance traffic management and minimize wait times.


**Testing & Real-World Validation:**
The model has been tested on real-time traffic data collected from **NH 8**, ensuring its effectiveness in real-world conditions. The results demonstrate improved traffic flow management by adapting signal timings based on observed vehicle density.
